    "question": "What is the SI unit of stress?",
    "options": ["Newton (N)", "Pascal (Pa)", "Joule (J)", "Watt (W)"],
    "correct": "Pascal (Pa)",
    "explanation": "Stress = Force/Area, so SI unit is N/m², which is Pascal (Pa). 1 MPa = 10⁶ Pa = 1 N/mm²."
  },
  {
    "question": "Hooke's Law states that stress is proportional to strain:",
    "options": ["Only for ductile materials", "Only within elastic limit", "For all materials", "Only for brittle materials"],
    "correct": "Only within elastic limit",
    "explanation": "Hooke's Law (σ = Eε) is valid only within the proportional limit where material behavior is linear elastic."
  },
  {
    "question": "Poisson's ratio is defined as:",
    "options": [
      "Longitudinal strain / Lateral strain",
      "Lateral strain / Longitudinal strain", 
      "Shear strain / Normal strain",
      "Volumetric strain / Linear strain"
    ],
    "correct": "Lateral strain / Longitudinal strain",
    "explanation": "Poisson's ratio (ν) = - (Lateral strain) / (Longitudinal strain). For most metals, ν ≈ 0.3."

  {
    "question": "Which material has the highest Young's modulus?",
    "options": ["Rubber", "Aluminum", "Steel", "Wood"],
    "correct": "Steel",
    "explanation": "Steel has Young's modulus ≈ 200 GPa, aluminum ≈ 70 GPa, wood ≈ 10 GPa, rubber ≈ 0.01-0.1 GPa."

  {
    "question": "The point where material behavior changes from elastic to plastic is called:",
    "options": ["Ultimate point", "Yield point", "Fracture point", "Proportional limit"],
    "correct": "Yield point",
    "explanation": "Yield point marks the transition from elastic (recoverable) deformation to plastic (permanent) deformation."
